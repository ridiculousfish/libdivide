sentence=Optimised integer division.
paragraph=libdivide.h is a header-only C/C++ library for optimizing integer division. Integer division is one of the slowest instructions on most CPUs e.g. on current x64 CPUs a 64-bit integer division has a latency of up to 90 clock cycles whereas a multiplication has a latency of only 3 clock cycles. libdivide allows you to replace expensive integer division instructions by a sequence of shift, add and multiply instructions that will calculate the integer division much faster.
